ABSTRACT
Rainfall in most of the countries is approximately uniform for an entire year whereas in India, rain is not uniform and is heavy for a span of 3-4 months, roughly between June to August; called as monsoon. Rainfall is a vital aspect of climate, whose importance is huge in certain parts of the world such as India. Here agriculture is strongly dependent on rainfall as the primary source of irrigation as well as various large-scale projects such as dams, reservoirs, roads, bridges etc are affected. So, for planning any agricultural policy or development project, it is important to carry out impact assessment and feasibility studies, using future rainfall as input. Hence the study of this typical rainfall over India is a matter of research. The purpose of this project is to derive an algorithm that can get the patterns of monsoon flow over India for which an approach to unsupervised learning is used where, two algorithms have been used namely, K-Means clustering algorithm and Mean Shift clustering algorithm. The results so obtained are compared with each other. The soî€¹ware used to achieve the aim of the project is Anaconda and Python. The final result holds the various plots of rain obtained for given 2 Identification of pattern of monsoon in India locations in India and also the comparison of dissimilarity between two similar looking patterns as obtained from two algorithms.


HOW TO RUN THE FILES
Step1: Download both the code files and re-save them with .py extention.
Step2: Change the pat of the location file and the rainfall data file according to file location saved in your system
Step3: Run the program
